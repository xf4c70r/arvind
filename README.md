# Hi, I'm Arvind Sudarshan! 👋

🚀 MS in Computer Science @ UC Davis | 🛠️ Software Engineering | 🧠 LLMs | 🔐 Hardware Security | 🧩 Explainable AI 
## 🌟 About Me

I'm a graduate student passionate about software engineering and the application of large language models (LLMs) across domains like hardware security, language learning, and financial literacy. Currently, I’m involved in two research labs:

- 🛡️ **Center for Hardware Embedded Security and Trust (CHEST)** @ UC Davis  
  *Use LLMs to identify RTL design flaws, optimize the design and identify any potential security vulnerabilities in a given design before fabrication.*

- 📚 **Artificial Intelligence Explainability and Accountability (AIEA) Lab** @ UC Santa Cruz  
  *Reducing hallucinations in LLMs and making the responses more explainable.*

## 🛠 Skills

Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, R . PyTorch, Flask, React, MongoDB, Django, Verilog, gRPC, CUDA, PyGame, LLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, Hardware Security, Chain of Thought (CoT), RAG, CI/CD, REST APIs



## Projects

### 🎮 [Gameboi](https://tinyurl.com/gameboiz) 
> *An open-source generative AI tool that creates complete 2D games from text prompts using GPT-4, DALL·E, and PyGame.*
- An open source tool that uses GPT4, Dall-E and PyGame to create customized 2D games based on user prompts. 
- It is designed to streamline the game development process by automating various stages, from generating game sprites and assets to writing PyGame code.
- It is also capable of troubleshooting if the game fails to run and improving itself based on user feedback. 
- Within a week of open sourcing Gameboi, it had 7 stars and multiple contributions on github. 


### 🧠 [StockSense](https://tinyurl.com/stocksenseplus)
> *A local LLM-based financial assistant built by fine-tuning LLaMA3-8B on historic stock market data.*
- Fine tuned a Llama3-8B base model on historic stock market data. 
- Developed as a part of my Advanced deep Learning course project to create a financial analysis tool which can run locally, analyze and predict stock trends. 
- LLMs have the potential to help you understand your financial portfolio based on current news sentiments but you can’t upload your sensitive data onto applications like ChatGPT.  
- Observed a 19% improvement in trend prediction and 28% improvement in sentiment analysis over Mistral7B and 10% improvement in trend prediction and 17% improvement in sentiment analysis over base Llama3-8B model

### 🗣️ [HindiSetu](https://github.com/xf4c70r/hindi-learning-assistant) 
> *A DeepSeek-powered platform for Hindi learners, currentlybeing used as a experimental learning tool @ Department of Middle East and South Asian Studies, UC Davis.*
- Deepseek powered platform to help novice and intermediate learners learn Hindi better. 
- Generates transcripts for a given youtube video and generate relevant Q&A based on the transcript which helps build student’s reading and  comprehension skills.
- Also implemented a dictionary and word lookup feature to help expand students vocabulary.
